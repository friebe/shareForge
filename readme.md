## 🛠️ Description  
**ShareForge** is a web app that allows you to simulate, customize, and export mobile share menus (Web Share API) directly in your browser. Say goodbye to tedious screenshots or complex design tools – ShareForge lets you create professional mockups easily and anonymously.  

---

## 🎯 Motivation  
Creating mockups for mobile share menus has always been inconvenient:  
1. **Screenshots on mobile devices** are awkward to edit and often include sensitive data that shouldn’t be shared.  
2. **Design tools like Photoshop** require downloads and a steep learning curve – too much work for quick mockups.  

With **ShareForge**, you can effortlessly simulate share menus in your browser using pre-filled example data, make changes on the fly, and export clean, anonymized results for professional use.

## 🌟 Features  
- **Simple Editing**: Customize icons, text, and menu options.  
- **Live Preview**: See changes in real time.  
- **Anonymization**: Use example data by default, perfect for mockups.  
- **Export Options**: Download your share menu as a screenshot or JSON file.  
- **Browser-Based**: No need for mobile devices or external tools – everything works in your browser.
